<h1>Karolina's favourite movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Annette</h3>
<p>Stunning movie by Leos Carax and Sparks - the vivid colour schemes, the music, and the overarching thematic of breathing is what really got to me.</p>
<h3>True Romance</h3>
<p>I used to watch this when I was home sick from school because my sister had the dvd. It represented the values of true love and fierceness that really spoke to me when I was a teenager.</p>
<h3>Ghost World</h3>
<p>Saw this in the cinema when it came. Very few other people were there - maybe this was too peculiar for my Swedish small town - but I loved it instantly. Unfortunately my appreciation of the character Seymour has led to several romances that I would've been better without. This has given me a better understanding of Enid's escape. I love movies that give you new perspectives depending on where you are in life.</p>
